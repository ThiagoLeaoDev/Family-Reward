<p align="center">An app to manage household tasks and set prices for them. Users with admin privileges can create tasks by adding images, names, descriptions, and most importantly, their values. All users will have access to a page displaying all available tasks. When starting a task, users should take a "before" photo to document, and upon completion, they should take an "after" photo. All completed tasks must be validated by admin users who will approve or reject the task execution. Each user has a profile page displaying their name, image, role, tasks executed in the week, earnings based on completed tasks, and tasks pending validation. At the end of each week, the earnings for each user will be calculated and their balance will be reset.</p>
